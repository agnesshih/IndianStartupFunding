        "We are an old and very traditional money manager from the USA, investing almost exclusively in the US. After the US economy had lost a lot of its growth trajectory and the FED predicted GDP growth to linger below a mere 2% annually, our clients have been running from our investment products. Where are they all going? After booking a tee time with one of our long-time clients, we heard some adolescents with smartphones talking about the start-up scene in India. There were wild tales about startups with valuations beyond $1B, called unicorns. Apparently, there was not a hint of a slowing economy over there. Is it time to go international? After multiple people confirmed the start-up hype in India, we concluded that it is time to get ourselves a snapshot of what is going on in India. Who is investing? Where are they investing? And most importantly, which companies are they investing in? As a team, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and finally, create a visualization in Tableau. Also, we chose the Indian Startup Funding dataset collected from multiple sources because of the varied types of funding covered, the sizable number of observations, and the time coverage from 2015 until May 2022, including the Covid-19 phase."
